      <p>Star Archive was made in p5.js using the <a href = "https://github.com/Lartu/p5.clickable">p5.clickable</a>
      library by <a href = "https://lartu.net/">Martin Del Rio</a>.

    <div id="info">
      <p>This point and click exploration game was created with the intention of exploring childhood memories
      and nostalgia. It's easy to forget and overlook fun or core components of our childhood and "Star Archive" is
      made to take the player through an exploration of Catherine's own childhood and hopefully unlock memories from
      the viewers own childhood that may have been long forgotten. Whether you were an Asian American kid growing up
      in middle class household Southern California in the early 2000's or not, "Star Archive" is a game that I hope
      you are able to resonate with on some level.</p>

    <div id="info">
      <p>The design of "Star Archive" is heavily influenced by early 2000's FLASH and console games, such as "Sue's Dress Up Machine",
      "My Sims Kingdom", "Cooking Mama" as well as Team Bean Loop's <a href="https://teambeanloop.itch.io/six-cats-under">
      "Six Cats Under"</a> and Niki Ito's <a href="https://showcase.p5js.org/#/2021-All/Artists-Activists-Interactive-Portrait/">
